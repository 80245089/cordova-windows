This is a draft implementation of a Cordova layer for Windows 7.

This project can be built using Visual Studio 2010. Doing so creates a Win32 program that hosts a IE-based web view
and loads www/index.html inside it. The supplied cordova.win7.js file has partial support for Cordova events an API
sets, and is able to interact with the hosting program (native side).

This is still very much work in progress, and further development, including bug fixing, will be required before
this can be considered suitable for deployment.

Internet Explorer 9 or newer is required.
