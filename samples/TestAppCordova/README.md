# Sample App using Accelerometer, Geolocation, and Compass
==

This is a sample application using the template generated by CordovaBuilder and the instructions given in the Cordova Win8 repo.

## Getting Started

Open the project, then build and run.

### Note
 - If the program is taking a while to run initially (the box with the X stays on screen for a while), stop the app, and rerun. This should have the app start up correctly.
 - This is a known issue.
